## TASK 1 : Prediction using Supervised Machine Learing
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. The training data is given which is to be used to train the machine learning algorithm, then plot the actual vs predicted values, evaluate the model and visualise the data. The code is written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and the libraries used are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and scikit-learn.
